#### PPH Web SDK Demo for Vanilla JS and Angular Web App


See the `frontend` directory for a vanilla JS web app. When running it and connecting to the mediator app
running locally on the windows machine, I notice style changes on the app.


See the `frontend-angular` directory for an Angular 7 web app. When running it and connecting to the mediator app running locally on the windows machine, I notice style changes and none of the buttons work anymore. IE clicking `Test Click` is not toggling the status anymore. The click event is not even fired anymore.
